Metagenomics sample design
metadata is super important
NEED PAIRED COVARIATES (ph, temp, region, health state, etc)
Trade off between number of samples and number of sequences per sample (due to multiplexing, MiSeq).
**Samples are more important than sequence** <-- due to be able to get any sort of statistical confidence
Unless you're specifically asking rare-microbiome questions...
Low depth: <10K
Analyze most abundant members
Mid: ~40K
inference of community composition
High: >100K
rare microbiome analysis

MiSeq needs some non-16S sequences to make the technology work (otherwise chokes on sequence similarity)
So one strategy is to use 12.5MB for a shotgun metagenome (or genomes from isolates) along
with 12.5MB of the multiplexed 16S samples

Microbiomes are dynamic (so let things settle down before starting your study) Don't just order
mice and immediately start the experiment upon arrival (jet lag and facility change)
Use negative controls (kits may not be sterile), watch out for contaminants
Process sterile water through the same process to see what the contaminants are
Sample storage (matter of debate) (snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80)
